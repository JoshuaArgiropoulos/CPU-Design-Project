# CPU-Design-Project
Creating a CPU from the ground up with Liam O'Regan 

The purpose of this project is to design, simulate, implement, and verify a Simple RISC Computer (Mini SRC)
consisting of a simple RISC processor, memory, and I/O.

Using the Intel Quartus II design software 

The system is to be implemented on the Cyclone III chip (EP3C16F484) of the DE0 evaluation board
or on the Cyclone V chip (5CEBA4F23C7) of the DE0-CV evaluation board.
